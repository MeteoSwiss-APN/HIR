\subsection{Conventions}

Some of the elements will allow to have different children type of nodes depending on the scope of the node.

There are two scopes: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt control\_flow} defines the scope of nodes where one or more of the parallel dimensions of the \concept{Domain} are not yet resolved within a \concept{Computation}
	\item {\tt domain\_computation} is the scope of nodes where all the parallel dimensions of the \concept{Domain} are resolved within a \concept{Computation}
\end{enumerate}
